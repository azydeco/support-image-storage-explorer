info: Using the extension with a Wordpress Media Library
---

### Requirements

- Wordpress site

## Authenticating with Wordpress

The Wordpress provider option does not currently have authentication. You can add a public Wordpress site url when adding a provider and the extension will fetch the json contents of the sites media library. Any images that have links in the json will be displayed on the extension main panel.

## Limitations

You cannot use the extension to upload images to or delete images from a Wordpress media library due to Wordpress providers not having authentication.
