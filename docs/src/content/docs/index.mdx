          Helping the Developer stay in the code
        </h1>
        <p className="">
          As developers we found ourselves constantly mentally switching between
          applications, coding, and login details as we gathered links,
          corrected spelling errors, and located assets for our projects.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          We developed Image Storage Explorer in response to our need to reduce
          that mental load, to avoid switching between applications, reducing
          the path between assets and code.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          The extension provides us with with a tool keeps us within Visual
          Studio Code. It connects us to local files, buckets, and assets. As a
          developer focussed on Cloudflare first it was originally built to
          answer that need. Since then we have added some of the usual suspects
          and we will be adding more as the opportunities arise.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          This extension is currently in Beta, we hope to get it to the VSCode
          Market place as both a free and premium version.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          What follows are some key concepts we have addressed in our VS Code
          extension.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-amber-600   font-normal">
          Pasting the image path directly into your code
        </h2>
        <p className="">
          From source bucket to source code the extension copies the path and
          html wrapper for the image directly as a point and click process.
          Later you will see how we extended this feature.

          Aiding in documentation creation with Markdown ready paste
        </h2>
        <p className="">
          Switching from HTML to Markdown when handling adding assets is a
          process which can cause developers to avoid the task of better
          documentation. We built this tool and use it for ourselves to answer
          this problem

          In the premium version of the Extension you can amend the mask which
          handles the cut/paste process.

          Cloudflare First

        <p className="">
          We think its time developers thought Cloudflare first, though other
          CDN buckets are available.

          Work Local if you need
        </h2>
        <p className="">
          Lets not ignore that sometimes the assets are within your own
          Workspace and you want to use them. We treat the local folder of the
          workspace the same we we treat the Buckets and focus developers on
          staying in a oject-key relationship with assets and media they wish to
          use.
